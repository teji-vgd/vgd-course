## Getting Started

<span className='text-center'>
This week we'll be learning about some basic components of games: the [canvas](), [sprites](), and [gravity]().
</span>

## Canvas, Setup, and Draw
<div className='wrap-row two-col'>
    <div className='writingSection'>
    ### Setting up the Canvas
    With p5.js, we can program the computer to draw pictures and animations onto a `canvas`. You can create a canvas, draw shapes on it, and program movements for the shapes to create animations or games.
    These programs are called sketches.

    **Try changing the dimensions and background color of the canvas.**
    
    What do the two numbers inside `createCanvas()` represent?

</div>
<div className='wrap-row'>
    <div className='writingSection'>
    ### Colors
    In p5.js, there are many ways to represent color so that the computer understands what to draw.

    You can represent color as text inside of quotation marks like `'yellow'` above.

    You can represent color as a *single number* between `0` and `255`.

    You can also represent color as 3 numbers, each between `0` and `255`, e.g. `(203, 20, 134)`. The 3 different numbers represent red, green, and blue (or RGB). Computers can mix shades of these 3 colors to create a new color (similar to mixing paint).
    * Example: bright red would be represented as `(255, 0, 0)` or purple might be represented as a mix of red and blue `(180, 0, 240)`.

    **Try changing the background color of the canvas by changing what's inside the `background()` function, using the three methods above.**

    ### Game Functions:  `setup` and `draw`
    A sketch has two main functions (these are named pieces of code that can be run over and over again).

    The `setup` function runs only once, whenever the play button is clicked or in this case whenever you make a change to your sketch.
    This makes the setup function good for any code we want to use to set up our games for the first time (like defining the pieces of a new level).

    The `draw` function runs many many times. In game design, this is often called "the draw loop." The `draw` function runs and updates the canvas 60 times every second to create animations.

    There is another helpful keyword `frameCount` which keeps tracks of how many frames have run so far (from the last time the code was run).

    **Press <PlayIcon /> to see the background color slowly change based on the `frameCount` as the draw loop runs.**

</div>

## Sprites
<div className='wrap-row'>
    <div className='writingSection'>
    Sprites are interactive components of your game, this includes game characters, objects, walls, etc.
    Anything the player may interact with is a sprite.

    Use `new Sprite()` to create a sprite.
    </div>
    <MiniEditor horiz title={'Creating a Sprite'} code={spriteStarter} />

    <div className='writingSection'>
    A sprite can have different characteristics that determine how it looks or even acts.

    For example, adding a width `w` and height `h` to the sprite defines how big or small it is and whether it's a square or rectangle.
    Try changing the numbers after `sprite.w =` and `sprite.h =` to see what happens to the sprite shape.
    **Click <PlayIcon /> above to run your changed code.**
    </div>
    <MiniEditor horiz title={'Sprite Dimensions'} code={spriteDimensions} />

    <div className='writingSection'>
    Sprites can also be other shapes. For example, adding a diameter `d` to the sprite turns the sprite into a circle.
    </div>
    <MiniEditor horiz title={'Circle Sprite'} code={circleSprite} />

    <div className='writingSection'>
    You can change where the sprite shows up on the screen by controlling its `x` and `y` positions.
    </div>
    <MiniEditor horiz title={'Sprite Position'} code={spritePosition} />
    <div className='wrap-row'>
        <div className='grouped-editors'>
        <MiniEditor title={'Sprite X'} baseSketchFun={spriteFun} code={spriteX} />
        <MiniEditor title={'Sprite Y'} baseSketchFun={spriteFun} code={spriteY} />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

## World
<div className='wrap-row'>
<div className='writingSection'>

Sprites interact in a world. The `world` contains properties that are helpful for adding game physics like gravity affecting how sprites fall down.

**Press <PlayIcon /> to see the gravity affect the sprite on the right.**

Try changing `world.gravity.y` to observe what happens to the sprite.
</div>

<MiniEditor horiz title={'Gravity'} code={gravityBroken} />

<div className='writingSection'>
In the previous example, the sprite leaves a trail behind as it falls. This is because the sprite is secretly getting drawn to the screen over and over again at a rate of 60 times per second. So as it's falling the movement gets captured frame by frame. However, we're not telling the background to draw again and again along with the sprite.
</div>

<MiniEditor horiz title={'Gravity (Fixed)'} code={gravityFixed} />
</div>
